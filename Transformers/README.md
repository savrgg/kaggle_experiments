The code demonstrates a simplified version of the self-attention mechanism used in Transformer-based models, particularly in the context of natural language processing. To understand the theory behind this code, let's break down the key concepts:

## Self-Attention Mechanism:

The self-attention mechanism is a fundamental component in the Transformer architecture. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence when processing each element. In NLP, this mechanism is often used to capture relationships and dependencies between words or tokens in a sequence.

## Scaled Dot Product Attention:
The central operation in self-attention is the calculation of scaled dot product attention. It involves three main components: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices.

- Q (Query): Represents the current word or token that we want to find relationships with.
- K (Key): Represents all words or tokens in the sequence, used to compute how well each of them matches the current Query.
- V (Value): Represents the values associated with each word or token, which are used to produce the weighted sum of values.

## Dot Product Calculation:

The code computes the dot product of the Query and the transposed Key (K.T). This operation quantifies how much attention each Key should pay to the Query.

- Scaling:
To stabilize the training process and prevent gradients from becoming too large, the dot product is scaled by dividing it by the square root of the dimension of the Key matrix. This scaling factor is a key feature of the scaled dot product attention.

- Optional Masking:
The code includes an optional masking mechanism. This allows for the masking of certain positions in the input sequence. For example, in language models, you might want to prevent attending to future words (positions that have not been seen yet). Masking is achieved by adding a large negative value to the scaled dot product, effectively discouraging attention to masked positions.

- Softmax Function:
The softmax function is applied to the scaled dot product. It normalizes the attention scores, producing a probability distribution that represents how much each Key should contribute to the output for the given Query.

- Weighted Sum:
The attention scores, obtained from the softmax function, are used to calculate the weighted sum of the corresponding Values (V). This step produces the output for the current Query, which captures the relationships with other words or tokens in the sequence.

- Visualization:
The code provides visualizations of the scaled dot product, attention scores, and the output (weighted sum) to help you understand how the mechanism works.
